## 🧠 Problems Faced & Solutions

### Middleware Redirection Loops

**Problem:** While protecting routes, I faced redirection loops between `/login` and `/dashboard`.  
**Solution:** I refined the middleware logic to properly check session existence and current pathname, and excluded routes like `/_next` and `/auth` from protection.

### OAuth Callback Redirect Issue

**Problem:** After deployment, Google login was redirecting back to `localhost` instead of the production domain.  
**Solution:** Supabase still had `localhost` saved as the Site URL. Updating the Site URL and redirect configuration in Supabase fixed the issue.

## 🗄️ Supabase Database Setup

Run the following SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
create table bookmarks (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  title text not null,
  url text not null,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade not null
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
alter table bookmarks enable row level security;

-- Policy for inserting
create policy "Users can insert their own bookmarks"
on bookmarks for insert
with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy for viewing
create policy "Users can view their own bookmarks"
on bookmarks for select
using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy for deleting
create policy "Users can delete their own bookmarks"
on bookmarks for delete
using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### ⚡ Enable Realtime

1. Go to **Database** → **Publications**
2. Open `supabase_realtime`
3. Add the `bookmarks` table

This enables live updates across multiple tabs.

## 📌 What I Learned

This project helped me deeply understand OAuth authentication flows, Supabase Row Level Security, and real-time database subscriptions. It was my first time using Supabase in a production-ready app, and building this end-to-end system was both challenging and rewarding.
